# Extracting Hot Trending Topics from Research Abstracts

This project presents a data-driven framework to identify emerging research trends across scientific domains by analyzing large-scale abstract data. Implemented in a single Jupyter notebook, the methodology combines time-aware frequency analysis, growth factor computation, and graph-based domain modeling to uncover hot topics and shifts in research priorities.

## Use Case: Self-Driving Car Domain
The framework was applied to analyze research abstracts related to autonomous vehicles. Key findings include:

| Subfield                                                | Trend         |
| ------------------------------------------------------- | ------------- |
| Artificial Intelligence & Computer Vision               | Steady Growth |
| Robotics                                                | Surge         |
| Human-Computer Interaction & Computer Systems & Control | Emerging      |
